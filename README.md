- 👋 Hi, I’m @SaniaKawade, Final year ECE student with a keen interest in analytics.
- 👀 I enjoy wiring up devices in the world of IoT and embedded systems just as much as wiring together insights from data. When I'm not tinkering with microcontrollers, you'll find me practicing my SQL spells, exploring MongoDB and Snowflake landscapes, or turning numbers into narratives with BI tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Snowflake and Apache.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on analytics projects to develop data driven insights.
- Also, Open for IoT based projects :)
- 📫 Reach me on : saniakawade12@gmail.com
